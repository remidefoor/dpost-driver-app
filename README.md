# Driver App

## Description

The Driver App is a microfrontend developed for the dPost driver community.  
Drivers can search for packages that need delivery, based on location.  
Once a suitable package is found the driver can select it for pickup.  
Then, the app guides the driver through the complete delivery process.

### Technology Stack

#### Bulma

The CSS framework Bulma is used to achieve a consistent design accross multiple applications.
